# Task 6: Create and Evaluate Strong Passwords

###  **Objective**

To understand what makes a password **strong or weak**, create multiple passwords of different complexity levels, test them using **PasswordMeter.com**, and learn how complexity impacts security against attacks like **brute force** and **dictionary attacks**.

---

##  **Steps Performed**

### **1. Create Multiple Passwords**

Made 4–5 passwords with different complexity:
```
tanya123
Tanya@123
T@ny@_2025
T@nY@_2o25!#
T@nY@_2o25!#Cyb3r$
```

---

### **2. Test Each Password on PasswordMeter**

Each password was tested on **[PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)** to check:

* Overall **Score (%)**
* **Complexity rating** (Weak / Medium / Strong / Very Strong)
* **Additions and Deductions** based on:

  * Number of characters
  * Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
  * Repetition and pattern detection

</p>

### **3. Note Scores and Feedback**

| Password             | Score | Complexity  | Key Observations                  |
| -------------------- | ----- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `tanya123`           | 38%   | Weak        | Lacks symbols & uppercase letters |
| `Tanya@123`          | 58%   | Medium      | Improved with uppercase & symbol  |
| `T@ny@_2025`         | 78%   | Strong      | Good symbol and length usage      |
| `T@nY@_2o25!#`       | 91%   | Very Strong | Balanced mix of characters        |
| `T@nY@_2o25!#Cyb3r$` | 100%  | Excellent   | Highly random, long, and secure   |

 **Observation:**
The more diverse and longer the password, the higher the score and complexity level achieved.

### **4. Identify Best Practices**

| Practice                                           | Why It Helps                    |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Use at least **12–16 characters**                  | Harder to guess or brute-force  |
| Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols** | Adds randomness                 |
| Avoid **common words or patterns**                 | Prevents dictionary attacks     |
| Don’t **reuse passwords**                          | Stops multiple account breaches |
| Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `BlueSky!Cyber2025`) | Easy to remember yet strong     |
| Enable **2FA**                                     | Adds extra protection layer     |

---

### **5. Tips Learned**

✅ Simple changes like adding one symbol or capital letter increase strength significantly.
✅ Short passwords are easy to crack even if they look complex.
✅ Long passwords or phrases perform best on all strength meters.
✅ Always check password feedback before using it in real accounts.

### **6. Research on Common Password Attacks**

| Attack Type             | Description                             | Prevention                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Brute Force**         | Tries all possible combinations         | Use long, random passwords           |
| **Dictionary Attack**   | Uses common words or known passwords    | Avoid real words or names            |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Tries leaked passwords on other sites   | Never reuse passwords                |
| **Phishing**            | Tricks users into revealing credentials | Always verify website URLs & use 2FA |

---

### **7. Summary – Effect of Password Complexity**

* **Weak passwords (under 8 chars)** are easily cracked.
* **Medium-strength passwords** resist basic guessing but not automated attacks.
* **Strong passwords (12+ chars)** with mixed characters take years to brute-force.
* **Very strong, random passwords** are practically uncrackable with modern tools.

## **Conclusion**

This task clearly demonstrates how password **length, complexity, and randomness** dramatically increase security.
Using diverse characters, avoiding patterns, and enabling 2FA are essential steps toward **strong password hygiene**.
